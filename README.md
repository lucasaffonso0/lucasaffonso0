### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is JosÃ© Lucas! I currently work as a DevOps Engineer, I have a degree in Cyber Security and a passion for technology and information security. My technology stack includes Linux, Network Fundamentals, Programming (Bash, Python, Php and Javascript), Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, Ansible, ELK, Netdata and others.

During my free time, I enjoy breaking out some k8s clusters in my homelab, going to the gym, playing guitar at church, and spending time with my loved ones.
